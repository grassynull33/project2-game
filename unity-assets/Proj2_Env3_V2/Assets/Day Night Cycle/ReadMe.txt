To setup this system just drag and drop the prefabs from Day Night Cycle->Prefabs in to the scenes

ReName the layer no. 8 to "DayNightCycle"

Make sure to disable any pre-existing directional light as the prefabs have their own

Import the Camera Rig from prefab folder into the scene as well otherwise whole system will fail , make sure to use this prefab as your main camera.("You can also create your own but it has to have same settings").

for more info on how each and every variable works , open the DayNightCycle script and read the comments.

Thank You.
